These are the current limitations the server faces:

1. Broker Account Validation: When users try to connect their broker account, 
    they send their broker information to the server. The server then tries to 
    validate the account by logging into the terminal to check if the credentials 
    are valid. However, since MT5 can only handle one account at a time, it disrupts 
    any other processes happening in the background.

2. Similar to the first limitation, due to the MT5 one-account-at-a-time restriction, 
    multiple accounts cannot be used concurrently. Despite trying multiple strategies 
    like using multiple MT5 instances, threading, multiprocessing, and asynchronous 
    programming, these approaches haven’t fully solved the issue.

Given all these challenges, efforts have been made to tackle this, but for now, 
I found a tool online: https://www.mtsocketapi.com/index.html MTsocketAPI. 

This tool provides a configuration to link to your MT5 terminal, 
acting as an API to stream market data, send orders, and more, 
accessible from any programming language. 
However, the tool lacks account login functionality, which is a crucial part.

At this point, I want to be realistic. The solution I’m considering is for us to build a library or interface 
using a low-level programming language like C or C++ to have finer control over every action. 
I’m currently researching how to achieve this but just wanted to highlight how much work this might involve for all of us.
